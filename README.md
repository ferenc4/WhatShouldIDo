# WhatShouldIDo
# Issue
If we divide our time up too much for too many different hobbies during the our free time, it is really fun, but some days we wake up thinking we don't know what to do.
Have you noticed when you are not bored you have all these things you want to do, but when you are bored you can't think of one?
It's because you have no good way of keeping track of those ideas.
Sure, you can write them down in a notepad or in your phone. Log the times you did the activity and how much you enjoyed it.

But it feels clunky. I don't want to have to check my notepad or my phone and see an unorganised cluster of ideas.
Why? Because when I am bored, the abundance of options makes it even harder to decide.

# The Vision
Upon completion WhatShouldIDo will allow users to:
- set their likes (manually and automatically)
- organise their days
- and receive suggestions for things they could do in their free time

Users can pick from different categories, such as going out (restaurants, clubs), watching multimedia (YouTube, movie, tv show).

Users can specify their likes, and with some slight, occassional variation, the item uses the internet to give you options.
What movie should I watch today?
What food should I cook today?
What should I do when I go out with friends?

WhatShouldIDo will help you answer these questions and make it feel like it took no extra effort from you.

# Requirements
The UI should be very simple, that different people will like even in different moods.
It is beyond the scope of this project to develop an immersive chatbot, but 'Buddy' should:
- provide occassional compliments
- tell users what they should do
- get user satisfaction with the offer
- get user rating of the activity
- and generally keep users happy through it's interface and language
